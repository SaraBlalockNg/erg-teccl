Second, working is a vital thing.

Secondly, like the western Christmas, the Spring Festival is the most essential festival in China.

First , one is western festival , the other is eastern festival .
The developent of literature in china has a very long history.
The development of the ancient literature has not ceased.
China has a lot of famous writer, they work with us to grow.

The first teachers are us parents.
They teach us how to move slowly, how to eat softly, also how to fall asleep quietly.
They are a kind of teachers who really be good forever.
The second teachers are school teachers, they give us useful knowledge carefully, of course, we will use it in our life time whenever and wherever possible, so it is very important to listen to the teachers earnestly in school states.
Besides, I think the most important thing in life is our teacher.
Because we can gain experience from failure, what we do depends on what we think.
So it is necessarily to think what life is ourselves.
Time is money.
As the saying goes, An inch of time is worth an inch of gold  .
Unfortunately, although people know the value of time, they have been always wasting time.
Some people use their time to watching Tv, surfing on internet, playing computer games and so on.
In my opinion, I think we should form the good habit of saving time, do not put off what can be done today till tomorrow.
A famous chinese saying goes like this, Time can not be purchased with gold  .
As a student, I should use my time to finish my homework on time.

From all these years in my life, Dan must be the weirdest person I have ever seen.
I was in the drive-training center all this summer to make full preparation for my driving test.

And he has a crew cut and a thin face with a high-cheek-boned.
His clothes are usually the casual one.
On a hot summer day, he always wears a T-shirt and jeans when he comes to the drive-training center.
People who meet him for the very first time probably consider him as a some kind of scholar.
But he enjoys to grinning to people around him with his deep-set eyes.
It is definitely kind of creepy, though.
Just imagine, a person who simply smile to you without any excuses.
He is so different from other people in a peculiar way.
Generally, you should train yourself for almost 2 or 3 months to make sure you are qualified to pass the test.
He hit the stake intentionally every time he drove .
No one could figure out why he did this.
And finally, I asked him why he did it.

Meanwhile , teachers should also attach due important to spelling .
Students should pay great attention to spelling .

Besides, government should take effective measure to put on end to the drug.

Nowadays, people have higher standard for food and drinks.
However, food safety has become a problem.
As far as I am concerned there are two reasons .
Firstly, Businessman want to get more profits, in order to make the food more delicious, they had to use food additives that are bad for our health.

Before people have the etiquette, but now we don't have this.
We lost it.
In today's society, can be more and more people learned to reach the goal by hook or by crook, earned to gain can be despicable, learned to benefit struggles can be set to kill.
Now the competitiveness of the society more and more stronger, the to the faster pace of life also, people have more and more desires, people morals to gradually collapse.
May be The Chinese courtesy of courtesy not Suitable for modern society, but that is ancestors left To our wealth, we can't afford to lose it.
First of all, I can communicate with foreigners conveniently who can show their culture .
Secondly, it is very easy to read english books to solve some difficult problems.
Most physicians want to pay appropriate attention and want to do it ethically.
To solve this problem, physicians' organizations endorsed a Physician Charter that commits doctors to medical professionalism in the new millennium.
The first principle of a charter is the primacy of patient welfare.

My favourite TV programme is The Legend Story  , this TV programme is broadcast on Jiangxi TV.
It began in the evening 9:00, and by the end of two hours.
The content of this TV program is same to its name, it shows viewer one story after another.
In my opinion, each story of this program is especially.
In these stories, one part is about the infill, one part is about the immoral, and one part is about the unfamiliar null of nature.
The reasons I like this program are quite a lot.
On the one hand, it can satisfy my curiosity, every story makes me surprised, on the other hand, from these story, I saw another side of human nature, for example, the human not moral.
The more importantly, these stories inspired me a lot.
It let me recognize, respect the natural law is extremely important.

The top students of university are enviable.
Fistly, top students are all clever but not the best .
The reason why they become top students is that hard working.
Although they have high IQ , they know : No pains , no gains.
So they always study steadfasty.
Secodly, top students always make full use of their time, they know the time is equal to everyone, but peple use it in different way, and the result of course are different.
Thirdly, top students have a strong ability what they can put themselvese into things deeply.
After knowing the top students' unique advantages, I determine to follow them.
Once, I was determined to go to study so hard that I tested to the first class during an exam.
However, my teacher didn't believe me and she thought that I had cheated.
I studied much harder, not only did a lot of exercises, but also as long as the subject would not understand, I consulted students everywhere until understood them.
The result of hard work was that I tested as the first in class again.
I suppose that playing basketball is the best way to exercise.
Consequently, I have poured much time on it.

Maybe it is not only a kind of sports, but also a great lesson, which encourages us to pursue our dreams.
When we grow old, we can say: I have no pity.
Normally, being in good health is our first dream.
As time goes, many of us are not much healthier than before.
All of us have our dream, and I am only an ordinary boy with my dream.
I just intend to be a healthy boy.
Sports go ahead, then health follows.
Everyone should be in good health, and then they can do anything that they intend to do.
If you don't have a healthy body, you can do nothing.
From the picture, we can see choose the biggest holiday at home people proportion , is thirty eight percent.
While twenty seven percent of people choose to travel abroad.
The other twenty four percent of people choose the movies and friends sing to spend the holiday.
I think the holiday has many benefits.
It is exciting to visit different places.
As you travel , you will see beautiful scenerise typical of the region.
Besides, you can meet and make friends with people of different colors and races.
Finally, you can get to know to customs and living habits of the local people.
The main reason why people travel is, perhaps, for pleasure.
For example, having worked hard throughout the weekdays, people will find a widened trip to the nearby mountains or beaches a real relaxation .
On the other hand a vacation zt home also has a lot of benefits.
Such as cultivation of body ang mind with family.
Each peoples mind , so choose a holiday the way is different also.
Every children are eager for happy childhood when they are young.
They have good self-control.

Every workday, we should get up at 6:00a.m and quickly eat breakfast and go to school at 6:45a.m.
At school, we should hand in our homework before the first lesson.
We have Chinese, Maths, English, Physics, Chemistry, History, Geography, Political, PE, Music class and art.
When the classes are over, we have to go home quickly and write our homework until 11:30p.m.
As we know, in China, children go to school when they are three years old.
From which we can see China attaches great importance to citizens' education.
For an individual, first of all, we can learn basic life common sense of all aspects such as physics, chemistry, math and so on by receiving education.
Secondly education teaches us how to get along with others and how to integrate into society.
From what has been discussed above, we can draw a conclusion.
Education has been significant progress in the daily life of human beings.
Only through education can we improve our comprehension of things and find the way forward.
At the same time, it also improves the quality of people's lives.
As is vividly depicted in the drawing, in front of the table, people are playing their mobile phone without any conversation, ignoring the dishes.
It holds to apparent that the picture is indicative of pervasive problem with regard to people mobile phone.
People are able to integrate some classmates and invite their friends by cell phone messages.
As we all know, mobile phones can bring people great convenience and shorten the distence among friends.
However, as a growing number of individuals are addicted to mobile phones, more and more people prefer to connect others by phone rather than communicating.
Wha's worse, people become indifferent to their friends, neighbours, as well as relatives.
In my opinion, communication is nessary to our life.
Mobile phones are just tools to get along better with each other.
I have a large family, include my father, mother, and my bother.

Nowadays, more and more people go to the cities consequently the cities become overcrowding.
Therefore there are many problems in the cities.
First of all, the traffic become inconvenient.
People go to work by bus or subway always in the crowed situation and sometimes they should wait a long time because the vehicles are too crowed to admit a person more.
Secondly, the natural resources such water and electricity are consumed a lot thus cause the resources tight.
Based on the problems, I consider that we should take some measures to solve them.
On the one hand, our country could continue to take the family planning policy to control the number of population, which may solve the problems fundamentally.
On the other hand, the nation should carry out some policy to promote country development so that the countrymen can earn their living in their hometown.
As is known to us , many college students are wanting in social practices.
But who can tell us why many college students don't take an interest in taking part in social practice.
But the fact is that some college students keen to take part in social practices .
Though things always have two sides , taking part in social practices do more good than harm.
It is true that taking part in social practices occupies our free time to study or play.
But college students benefit a lot from taking part in social practices .
Taking part in social practices can improve interpersonal skills, through chatting with others.
Taking part in can make us more good to adapt to the society .
Thirdly taking part in social practices can practice our practical ability .
Last but not least nothing is more important than taking part in social practices to college students.
We all know that as the improvement of China people's living standards, the computer be used by more and more people, especially in youth.
However, when they use a computer, some bad habit would result that short-sighted of eyes.
As for me, when we play the computer, we need a bright condition.
Otherwise, we should have a rest when we use computer for a long time.
I cannot remember the not-so-little things during this holiday, but it has influenced my life.
As I think of the summer holiday, mixed emotions come flooding back.
After I handed in the final exam paper, I with some friends got on the train to DaZhou, in which we would take up our part-time job-as a teacher.
It was obviously difficult for us to start our work.
First, we had to rent a house, or we would live on the streets.
Then, we started to advertise our training institution.
Although it was terrible that the burning sun made us tired, we stuck to receiving every student and his or her parents happily.
At the same time, we had to explain all kinds of questions from them.
As an English major, it was reasonable for me to teach English.
I taught middle school students who were very active and friendly, they studied hard and were interested in chatting with me.
Sometimes, they invited me to fish and climb mountain.
Besides, I taught a boy separately afternoons, he called me sister and usually bought some delicious food for me.
A month was short, but memories were everlasting.
During the summer holiday, I learnt how to teach students properly, how to overcome some unexpected trouble and how to be a friend as well as a teacher .
Very few schoolmate our school and our school is poor in resources.
We have difficulty with learning, but there is no one but longs to go to college.

What I mean is, with distance learning from the Internet, students are no longer forced to study at certain time.
Last but not least, distance learning not only benefits ordinary people, but is convinient for students with disabilities to study from the Internet.
For the disabled students who have difficulties in going to schools, that colleges offer qualifications through distance learning from the Internet  is definitely a good news.
One aspect is the distance learning from the Internet will improve fast and provide everyone with equal opportunity.
The progress of science and technology is bringing us much convenience.
So, e-books are popular among the young people.
Many young people think that e-books can function as a symbol of fashion.
There is no doubt that e-books can become the good method of learning more knowledge about the world.
If you possess an e-book, you will not need wasting lots of time to find the book in the library which you want to read.
Comparing with the traditional books, e-books have more strong points.
For instance, e-books don't take up much space, at the same time, e-books are very light.
You can go to everywhere with your e-book.
  There are some disadvantages of using e-books.
It is possible for us to be addicted to it.
We may become lazy because we needn't finding books in the library.
If we are always stared at the screen, we will have a lasting influence on our eyesights.
Different kinds of e-books have different quality.
Some e-books are of poor quality which will have radiation.
In my opinion, e-books make our daily lives more abundant.
We can keep pace with the times.
It is important for us to know that we should the ture action to use the e-books.
We should try our best to give free rein to e-books'advantages.
In a word, making best use of the advantages and avoid the disadvantages.
I want to study English for three reasons .
First, in the international community, English is world language which is world's broadest use of language.
Second, if we learn English, not only can we grasp a living skill , but also we can communicate with foreigners to broaden our horizon.
In wy heart, wherever you come from, whatever you are beautiful or urgly, you can or to be a hero.
First, maybe they are just ordinary persons, like the leading character in our article.
Few years ago, a college student passed away, due to save a child who fall into the water.
The man need not have done it, he could just stand there or call the policemen.
But he not, his responsiblity said no  in his mind.
So under the  Somebody had to go in the water  , he made a choice that change his live with the little boy.
Only minutes before, he was walking down the street, but then he became a hero.
second, in most of children's heart, there parents are heroes.
I still remember a very moved thing which I haved watched on television.
A family encountered a flood.
They couldn't exist together in that situation, so they lifted their child highly to save him.
otherwise, these qualifies can't form in a short time, I can't believe a selfish person can use his live to save others.
Nowadays pollution has become an increasing concern in China.
When talked about pollution, it always occurs to us that the industrial activities take the most part of the reasons.
Actually there are diverse approaches which have made the increasing pollution.
Obviously worries and complains are of no use changing this situation.
We need take some feasible measures for the sake of our sustainable development.
Firstly, the government should strengthen supervision and management of the environmental protections during the economic development.
In another respect, as factories and farms, forming a strong sense of social responsibility and strictly comply with pollutant emission standards is important.
Last but not least, living healthily is our common dream.
It depends on both government and every ordinary citizen to make this dream come true.
I have been believe that the love between parent and child can never change .
My mother never spend money to dress up myself, one clothes of my mother can wear for many years, but every year she bough some new clothes for me.
This is my mother with my friend's mother of obvious of dissimilarity.
When I failed, my father would scold me for being incompetent and angry for my failure to bring him trouble.
From my mother there, I learn thrifty and strong.
The most important thing is that I learned what love is.
Some of them think that students can get online frequently.
The reasons are as follow: First, they think Internet can help them with their homework.
They can surf the Internet to get information and widen their kownledge.
Second, they can chat with their friends via the Internet though they live far away from their friends, it is convenient.
And they also share happy things with their friends.
Besides , they can enjoy themselves online.
The others hold different opinion.
They don't think it's good for students to get online frequently.
They think it's bad for students'eyes, and make more and more students have to myopia.
And lots of people indulge in chatting online and playing computter games, and make their marks be lower and lower.
But, in my view, every coin has two sides.
The internet has lots of advantage.
But you con't use it well, it may be bad for your study.
So I think it important to control youerselves and arrange your study well.
College is colourful and it can improve myself.
I come here .
I want I must exercise myself and more change.
We shouldn't spend much time making friends and playing games .
But I always spend too much time making friends and playing games.

The night sky was filled with fireworks, which is just like a colourful flower.
We went downstairs and set off fireworks.
The old year past, the new year comes.

I have learnt an extremely inspiring aphorism created by Mr.

Now I believe reading is not for us to find a good job but improve ourselves , enrich our mind and widen our sight.
So as Mr Bacon said, I think it's necessary for us university students to read the books that can develop our accomplishment of personal ability such as philosophy, art, literature and so on.
Therefore, I read some brilliant books recently.
I'd like to recommend the The history of Western Philosophy written by Russell to you.
It told about the history of the evolution of western philosophy and personal ideas of Russell.

Nowadays university merger has become a major concern around China.
Some universities become famous after the merger, such as The Jiangsu Institude Of Education.
Attitudes towards this issue vary greatly.
Those people who think university merger is reasonable believe that it can expand the scale of a university, extend the University faculties.
Also, university merger may change the situation that some universities are lack of students and increase the popularity of the universities.
The merger is conducive to the development of the university.
While others believe that not only does university merger make universities lose its original features, but also limit the self-development of the universities.
Even worse, the merger can be means of annexation that do harm to other universities.
As far as I am concerned, university merger conforms to the trend of the times.
The reasons are as follows.
Firstly, university merger can provide more professional options for students.
Secondly, it can bring a lot of benifits to university.
Last but not least, the merger can provide the university with a beautiful future.

Especially shopping on line, we can shop at anytime and anywhere just with a mobile phone or a computer.
Secondly, there are many kinds of goods on online store, such as clothes, foods, electrical product etc.
Although online shopping has many advantages and convenience, we should be a master of shopping on line.
The Internet is a virtual world, its systems are not safe, so being vigilant in anytime.

It meant I had to leave my favorite friends and beautiful hometown to live in a strong environment.
I cried loudly, but it did not make any difference.

One day, my parents were committed to business, they told me to buy some food for lunch.
I was frightened, I told them I could not manage it.
My father walked closed to me, just laying his hands on my shoulder and smiling at me.
Suddenly, I said Yes to him and rushed out.
From my experience, it is persuasive that Body language speaks louder than word, sometimes Body language is more effective than any other way.

Recently, six students who shared a dorm at a local university hired a cleaners to do laundry and cleaning once a week , which led to a heated debate .
Despite a lot of study tasks and homeworks, our college students still have a duty of doing laundry and cleaning , which can definitely enrich our daily life and make us fullfilling.
According to the newspaper , each of them paid cleaners 60 yuan a month , which indicates that they are not fully aware of their parents' sacrifice and love .
There is no denying that college life is not all about study, but learn to be independent.
If all of us choose to hire cleaners , I afraid that we will never have the capability of taking care of ourselves .
In conclusion , I do believe that hiring cleaners should not be encouraged .
Please.

As we all known that the university campus is not only a place to study but also a platform to build the personal independence.
However, there is a strange phenomenon that college students tend to hire cleaners to do laundry for them.
In China, a large number of teenagers under 18 are taken good care of by their dear parents at home.
It seems that what they should do is just studying before entering university.
But we must admit that this easy life style brings about the lacknessless of independence.
Us college students should learn how to arrange our personal life orderly and clearly.
If we cannot deal with these simple matters, let alone the future challenge we will face.

Becoming a government employees is more and more popular in recent years.
Such a problems can't be fixed immediately, but we can find the reason easily.
First, this job can earn pretty much of money, although there some other works can make more than it, as a government employees, you can have the rights and interests more easily like you can eat an apple on the table at home.
And the well-being can defeat any other company because the boss is our country and a country can't lose the credit.
Second, many parents want their child got this job because they think it is good for their children's future.
So, all of their child study very hard everyday for the civil service exam.

Since it was the first time for me to do dubbing for a movie, especially for the famous British movie Pride and Prejudice, as a result, this task greatly challenged me because I was not quite familiar with the elegant and noble British accent.
I should admit that this film was so attractive, romantic as well as dramatic.
Furthermore, I was so absorbed that my feelings also went up and down with the characters.

Most of us, as students, are careful with our money in daily life: we collect all kinds of coupons; we look for group-buy deals if we eat out or travel; we don't buy clothes unless in a sale.
Collecting all kinds of coupons, it seems that there being less money to spend, whereas, haven't you perceived that the frequencies of your shopping sprees are soaring.
In other words, you spend far more money on these seemingly cheaper brands actually.
Thus, I would like to say that if we merely running after all these special offers, to some degree, can't make us smart consumers.
To be smart consumers, we are required to attach much importance to quality.

It's better for us to keep a familiarity with our necessities as revealed in earlier contact with various trademarks.

I think however we are busy we can't overlook our family and friends.
Although we are busy with our things, we should give concern to them such as making a call often and going home usually.
The aged people only need to you to talk to them often and company to them.

They think that as the advance of this evaluation, teachers will pay much attention on it, absolutely, this will decrease their academic focus.
Additionally, some students may take the opportunity to retaliate some teachers that they prejudiced against all the time.
And then, teachers will not be strict with students as that of before to avoid students'grudges.
Though those disadvantages seems to be reasonable, I need to stand back and stick to my own colours.

Learning English is one of the most difficult yet most rewarding experience of our school life.
As a college student, learning English is a very necessary course.
I want to study English for different reasons.
First of all, English is the most popular language in the world.
So we must learn how to use it approprately.
Secondly, we know the importance of English.
As we know, an excellent skill in English equips the college students with good jobs.
But in my opinion, learning English can also give me insights into another culture, and my mind will open to new ways of seeing things.
Last but not least, the most important benefit is we can communicate with many more people than before.
