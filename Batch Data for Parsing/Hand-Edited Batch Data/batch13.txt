In addition, l am liking watching the movie of English from TV.
This can help us learn English much superior to before.
What is more, learning grammar is also a better way to learn English well.
Not only this, but also chatting with our friends in English is a useful way to learn English well.
Personally, l think it is necessary that we should pay attention to learning English, because English is more popular than before in the world.
There is an old saying Genuine knowledge comes from Practice  .
The first reason is that the knowledge in books is limited, the truth comes from the practice.
The second reason is that students put marks in the first place can contact the book knowledge better.
The third is when we enter the society, we need various abilities.
Second, you need to read more in the morning is when we remember the best, so we need to make full use of it to enhance our sense of time by reading English.

In this world, my parent is a crucial person to me.
I thank them bring me up grow up.
Nowadays, a number of students do not pay attention to spelling in English study.
The reason why appear this situation is that the way of our study have changed.
With the world is changing, our English study became more and more convenient, we university students almost have computers and cellphones, we can research the words in many ways, so we did not due attention to spelling, instead depend on electronic dictionary.
In my opinion, not only teachers should recommend students to pay more attention to spelling, but also we should not depend on our computer and cellphone to research the words.
What's more , some of them are worth reading, they can help us extend our horizons.
In junior middle school, Ididn'think highly of English, so I always slept in the class.

Finally, I became the second in our class.
In senior high school, I got a kind, patient, warm-hearted teacher.
I really like her, I focused more energy on English study.
As a result my English got a higher level.
This all my experience of English study.

As we all know, English is one of the most important subjects in our courses, and it is one of the most important languages in the world.
Language is the most important way to communicate with others in life, so learning foreign language well is very important to us.
First, I think we should use the foreign language in our daily life, for example, we can communicate with our friends.
Second, you should do a lot of practice and you need a dictionary to look for some words.
You also need a notebook to take notes.
All in all, succeeding in language learning is not very difficult.
Parents show their love to us, and we hold a firm belief to show it to our children.
First of all It can greatly improve the efficiency of environmental protection.

Secondly, we can use the control principle of reasonable design scheme against harmful environmental events.
With the development of people's living conditions, more and more people have nongovernmental cars, and the city traffic has been even heavier and more and more the traffic accident happen around us.
At the same time, what is more, air and noise pollution has become more serious.
Although the cars is convenient for us to go out, the traffic jams are now a major problem in most cities.
In my opinion, the increase of the private cars and the peopleï¼‡s lack of awareness of traffic regulations is the key to this problem.
Maybe our government should limit car industry development, and people should think carefully before they buy a car.
Meanwhile it is worthwhile for man to know about the traffic regulations, the more we realize about the regulations, the better life can we process.
So, for this purpose, we should do our best to overcome the difficulties.
People experiences a lot every day.
And the whole life is always abound in various experiences.
But it's for me, I will never forget that terrible experience.
I had the most unforgettable experience in my life when I was 17, as a senior high school student.
I still remember that day vividly.
That winter morning I get up a little late, it was half past five.
The morning, however, was still in darkness.
After washing my face, I got on my bike and rode off in a hurry, even without breakfast.
It was a ten-minute bike ride.
So I have to pick up speed in order not to be late for class, though I just can't see clearly.
When I rode to the last crossing that was absolutely near school, a small truck charged to me suddenly.
I failed to stop my bike as soon as possible.
Surely, I was knocked down with getting a flesh wound in my back.
Nevertheless, the driver didn't stop it.
With the darkness, he didn't see me.
One can only mature after experiencing different events.
That accident taught me a lesson I will never forget.
Faced with these moments, We should calm down.
And when walking in a street, we should make way for cars, and reduce our speed.
It is good for my body.
Our home has been seriously polluted.
We must face the music that the pollution problems are more than before and not only in the cities, but also in countryside.
Global warming, the dirty water and air, polluted foods and fewer trees and animals.
We put rubbish into the rivers and the seas.
This makes the water becoming dirtier and dirtier.
We cut down the trees.
This action kills the animals and makes the trees becoming fewer.
We burn things for energy and put gas into the air.
The air is becoming dirty.
We must solve these problems.
Here are some ways to protect the Earth.
First, we cannot throw the rubbish everywhere.
Second, use plastic bags and disposable products as few as you can.
Third, just stop putting the dirty water into the rivers and the seas.
Fourth, recycling things.
The last, we must plant more and more trees.
We have only one Earth.
It is our home.
I hope all of us can protect the Earth together.
Just do something for Earth, because it is time to rescue it.
As is know to all , books are the resource of knowledge and can not only broaden our horizons but also build our minds.
Books are to human what milk is to babies .
As far as i am concerned , just reading the books about our career is not enough.
Instead, we should acquire all kinds of culture and knowledge from diffrernt books.
you can read some books about philosophy and science which can expand you thoughts.
Masterpieces from home to abroad are also recommended to make you erudite.
Of course , there are many useful books I don't mention .
You can make decisions according to your own opinion.
I hope you can be addicted to the ocean of books and get what you want .
In my opinion, I believe that watching film at home is much better than go to the cinema.
As emotional human beings, we always encounter various affective problems and experience stress, resulting from numerous factors, including financial or academic expectation, limited resources, job competition and so on.
Firstly, stress makes people have some physical problems.
As darkness fell outside, you do have difficulty to be asleep.
Some people suppose that character education is only to let students acquire knowledge.
In the present society, moral cultivation is very important.
If we lose our moral quality, we can't do anything.
But how can we cultivate moral, it's a question.
At this time.
The importance of school is expressed.
Character education has supposed us to improve the moral quality.
We must improve our moral quality.
As we all know, everyone has a dream, and on some people's heart , there are plenty of dreams.
Last summer holiday, I failed the college examination.
My heart was filled with sorrow and even nothing could make me happy again.
I wanted to go to university, that's my dream.
Although I was very sad, I didn't give up my dream.
So I determined to spent one year to realise my dream.
The days were so boring.
Every day, the papers just like the flood, flew into my mind.
That year, my best friend was my little light.
Another matter was the exam.
So many times, I looked at my paper, but my mind was at a blank, just because of the mark.
I suppose that my hard work didn't pay off, but I didn't want to cry, you know, I can't cry.
That's true.
You have dreams, you must pay tears and hard work, especially perseverance.
What't more, convenience also plays an important part.
My hard work just like the sunshine , making my dream come true eventually.
One year later, I saw the university's gate finally opened for me.
The Internet a very important in our daily life.
Everyday many people surf the Internet.
When you meet difficult in your life.
you can chatting with your friends on the Internet.
However, every coin has two sides.
There is so much rubbish on the net, which are some medium messages about crime.
Net also make people waste time on it.
In addition, more and more finanvial crimes such as money laundering are committed via the Internet.
In my opinion, I completely agree with the latter view that the internet has more disavantages than advantages.
It gives rise to people's mental problems.
It results in various computer crimes.
In the modern time, there are a part of college students develop some bad habits, for example, they always stap up, cost money over their degree and are addicted to computer games.
In fact, these unhealthy habits are harmful to college students.
As a modern college student, we should have a good body and spirit.
We can build our bodies by doing morning excise or playing basketball and so on absolutely.
It is a good choice that read some meaningful books instead of playing computer games.
We should form positive attitude to spend our college life.
In our society, English is being more and more important.
As astudent.
I must study English conscientious in orthe to being success.
If my English level raise, I will being confident.

Being polluted by the harmful gases produced by cars and factory, the air is becoming dirtier and the main cities are suffering from great pollution.
The forest is destoyed by the people, which results in the serious environmental problems as well.
Hence, people have to endure the harmful things spread in the air and even absorb them, which lead to lung cancer and do great harm to our health.
To stop the pollution, government should control the quantities of cars and ban factory from pouring waste without necessary process.
In recent years, Blog is extremely popular in many countries.
A number of people use Blog to express ideas of their own about politics and events in the world.
On the one hand, some people who have some ideas about something intend to share them with others or don't tend to let others recognize who they are, so they discover a medium to speak their ideas freely-----Blog.
Otherwise, they also can make friends with many people.
Though Blog brings many benefits, its negative influence is dispensable.
Such as some lawless elements via it spread rumors.
Also a few businessmen in terms of it advertising, it is likely to harm the interests of the users.
I had been off duty two days and when I returned, the first news I heard was, Chris died yesterday morning.
I think the old know what loving truly means, the young can only guss.
First, teacher be asking student pay attention to spell.
Animals come from wild.
are kept in zoos.
Forty percent of people think that animals should be kept in zoos.
First, people can see many kinds of animals in the zoos so that they don't need to go to wild.
The other sixty percent of people think that animals should live in the wild, because animals love living in the wild.
In my opinion, animals should live in wild, because nature is their home and they don't belong to human beings.
I think people should stop polluting the environment and using the animals furs.
If I have kids things they can not decide, then the parents shouid be for the kid out of ideas , rather than to help them make decisons.
Of course , in some cases, the parents should give children some help.
Children entering school, for example, also do not know how to learn, parents can do some specific guidance or tutoring.
But should pay attention to two questions: one is to guide the children to think for themselves, to solve the difficulties in learning and not arranged to replace; The second is to the purpose.
When children are unlikely to learn, parents can with appropriately, temporarily when the children walking stick.
But when a crutch fundamental purpose is to help children come over difficult.
The topic of the Model United Nations is the Syrian Crisis.
At the same time, I know if we want to do a thing well, we should pay more attention to the information searching.
I want to stay in the city or in the country.
I hope parents can give me a suggestion.
Everybody has distinctive habit and the way of learning have to be different.
Everyone wants to get to a good achievement.
So we could exchange the way of learning and good ideas to improve ourselves.
We have to study hard when we want to learn something well.
Look a book is also a good way to get information.
A good book could be change our life.
As the same reasons, Internet can Be useful.
My favorite way of learning is learn by Surfing Internet.
But as we all know, Surfing Internet is also could be harmful.
And talk with friends often.
Friends will tell you some good ideas.
Where there is a well, there is a way.
I think if we study hard and are used to thinking how to learn well.
We could do it well.
As a girl, shopping is my favourite hobby.
Also, I like watching movie, reading and listening to music.
But, today's movies is more and more boring, the books content increasing lack of meaning.
Playing basketball, football, swimming, sports is not my hobby.
A lot of people ask me what kind of work will do in the future, I also tell them I would like to work in human resources in the office.
Because of what I major in my college, I hope I can learn how to get along better than others.
I'm not good at having a freewheeling conversation to others.
In my future work, I will often deal with others.
As we all know , the proper sports activities is an opportunity to intensify nearly all parts of our bodies .
Scientists of Public health college in Harvard found that doing some certain exercises , for example three hours per week can lower the risk of men's heart attack by 22% .
According the research, form 1990 to 2010, the percentage increases from 0 to 24%, then to 58%.
In my opinions, this phenomenon is attributed to there reasons.
for one thing, the students have more free time when they are in college, so they can select some part jobs.
for another thing, they can do some part-time jobs to get some money to buy what they wat and go where they like.
for this, they are able to help their parents ease the burden.
So we shold to lean powerful spirit when we making the difficulties.
Someone talk to me that they like to sing English songs.
But they don't know how to learn.
First of all, you should recognse the words in the song though you don't understand there meanings.
Second, listen to the singer how to sing the song again and again.
Third, follow the singer to sing the song.
This is my way to learn English songs.
As the saying goes:  Will's stand long will, is without will's and grow set his heart on.
Just like the Chopsticks Brother's movie  Old boys  .
By the science and technique development, we can see the advertisement everywhere.
First of all, it is essential for company to make customer recognize their products.
There is no doubt that advertisement is a great way to improve their character.
If we need some information, the advertisement will offer messages we need.
On the other hand, a lot of person may think some advertisement are annoying.
For example, when we surf the internet, there always will be a banners.
There are some spam in our email inbox.
We will frequently feel the advertisement is very troublesome.
In a word.
The image of college life had come to me off and on when I was in high school .
In the past , I thought if I enter the college I will have enough free time to do anything I like.
Thildly, We also have some free time in the afternoon or in the evening .
But we will spend the time attending lectures , reading reference books doing exercise , going shopping, chatting with friends and so on .
We can do so many things in college .
Last but not least , when in high school , I lived with my parents, but now , they don not live with me .
Spelling words correctly is the basis for writing.
Students attach less importance to the spelling of words in the process of English study.
There are possibly several reasons contributing to this phenomenon.
First examoriented education makes the students pay less attention to spelling.
Secondly, many English teachers don't provide students with adequate knowledge of building up new words.
Since spelling is one of the most important factors in English study, due attention should be given to it.
As fom, I think we should be made aware of the serious consequence of misspelling.
Then exams should be modified to add some factors into it, which would help students pay more attention to spelling.
The first, taking part in social practice can rich our experience and make our life briliant.
As a college student, most of us are common lack of experience about society.
We can let us more mature through social practice.
So we should cherish every chances that can strong us.
Besides, it can make us more confident.
Because of this, we don't just think studying.
Social practice is more good for us than reading.
Due to reading just expend our mental world.
On the contrary, social practice can rich our physical world.
If when we get into the society, we can adjust to some new environment quickly.
As time goes away, I'm 22 years old.
I found a part-time job last summer.
I think summer vacation is too long to us.
All of us want to do some signification to enrich our life and improve our ability.
As for me, I found a job that to be an English teacher.
Now I still remembered the first class I had given to them.
In the beginning, I can't make them calm down, because I didn't have any experience about it, So I followed the other people to improve my teaching skills.
At the third day, a third-grade teacher on leave, so the headmaster asked me to teach them.
I said yes without hesitation.
The first class I gave them some colors like red green, yellow blue and purple.
When I stood on the platform and saw so many eyes with hanger for knowledge, Suddely I felt a sense of responsibility, When I saw the headmaster was encouraged me, I really fall confident.
At first, I linked these words into life.
The children were very interested in it.
Then I try to put these word incorporated into the song that like Two Tigers, I sang it loudly and asked them to follow me.
The headmaster was satisfied with me, when I saw the children studied very hard, I felt well.
This is my most unforgettable experience, I learn much from this thing.
A bold attempt is half success.
So we should be courageous to face everything.
Relativitly, College students are more freer in time.
A lot of students make full use of their spare time and vocation to do some jobs.
Every coin has two sides.
Secondly, we can gain knowledge and accumulate social experience through doing part-time jobs.
In my opinion, I hold positive attitude for doing part-time jobs.
Because it makes me learn something what I can't learn in college.
What I lost is not worthy of mention comparing to what I gain.
Li Hua wants to be a fashion designer in the future because she does well in painting pictures and wants to design pretty clothes for the public.

An innocent kid is likely to be satisfied with staring at the blue sky and smiling upon the shining stars.
For example, in the morning, mom hurried up to ask my dad and me to get up because dad and I were absorbed in a football game on TV with drinking juice and laughing at the mom of sleep last night.
Because there is someone still worries about you.
Anyway, there is no exact definition of the word happiness.
In my opinion, an ordinary family is enough to deliver you, embrace you and make you happy when you get lost on the way.
As the life gets better, more and more people are interested in the pets.
They raise the pets that gradually become their friends.
Not only do people know what is love, but also animals know it.
People may feel better to be with lovely animals than to be with human beings, because animals are more simple in heart than people.
Besides, animals are usually cute to us, which makes us put our hearts to them.
In my opinion, we can devote ourselves to the pets, raising them as our children.
Love between people and animals should be protected.
Some people hold that the gap is natural because it reflects different contributions that different people make in their work.

But at the same time, a growing unrest over food safety in China has caught everyone's concern.
Food scandal appears one by one.
I think, first, we should growing awareness of the issue.
To growing it, the government should improve and perfect the law, make food producer dare not to produce food which are harmful to people.
And than the government should make everybody know the harmful of such poisonous food.
I really pray that the issue of food safety will be solved successfully.

Now, I am a student from the NORTHEAST NORMAL UNIVERSITY.
For example, I did not live with my roommates but just lived with my parents in the past years .
And I meet a lot of people from different places now.
For Another, my school life was surrounded with teachers and they controlled all the things in the past.
However, the teachers in the university would like to give the students more time to learn by themselves.
And now I can join many interesting organizations to make me go through more experience than in the past years.
What is more, I can show my talents adequately.
I think the life in the university would be more colorful and more abundant than the life in the past years.
So, I must value the life now.
I will not only study well but also join the activities energetically.
An excellent example, of a person's words and actions both disclose his/her attitude and intention can be found in Kobe Bryant, who was almost winning every single paramount basketball prize all his career.
He said to his father that I would beat up Jordan one day.
Another compelling illustration that one's intentions can be affirmed in both his/her words and actions is Audrey Hepburn.
She not only expressed her deep concern towards impoverished kid's rights by her speech Be With You in 1989, but also went to Somalia to look after those moribund children for the starvation at the end of 1992, when she had a serious cancer.
As an old the Chinese adage said: Talking without practice is fake, and practice without talking is dumb.
Nowadays, with the development of economy.
More and more people all consider competition and cooperation.
It's something like that competition and cooperation have become an essential part of our daily life.
Competition in modern society has established cooperation, which is everyone's face common task.
But competition can stimulate individual initiative and enthusiasm and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of learning to potential of filling.
We can compete when we play games, try to do better than others in our study and so forth.
These are constant competition for jobs, fame, wealth.
There is a development.
In study, some people work hard because none of them wants to fall behind.
In company, the competition is very strong obviously.
Everybody wants to get better position.
It can be good for the complete company to develop.
So there are no forever friends nor rivals, but interest.
To sum up, competition and cooperation prevail throughout the world.
Even though I advocate competition, we should not turn a blind eye to the competition in front of us.
Also, we cannot refuse to collaboration with others.
At the same time, I also exercise my ablity in the activities.
What's more, doing some sports not only make me healthy but also be a good way for me to relax.
Take part in after-school activities is a good choice for you if you want to make your school life more colourful.

On the one hand, keeping pets has some benefits.
First, it can bring happiness to the old and let the young learn how to become more responsible people.
On the other hand, there are also some troubles when we are keeping pets.
Firstly, pets like dogs are always noisy and bark at strangers.
If some pets are so naughty that make your things dirty and messy, you will be angry with them but you ca do nothing to them.
Secondly, it will take additional cost to keep pets.
In my opinion, pets can help people a lot.
For example, guide dogs are the blind's eyes that lead to anywhere.
However, I don't thing that it's a good idea to raise pets.
The snow was so thick.

However, the students who spend too much time on them will fall behind others.
In general, I suggest that people make proper use of them.
Shopping on the Interent has abundant advantages.
The most essential of which is its convenience.
People prefer staying at home and shopping for things to wasting their precious time and energy on going from one shop to another.
Nevertheless, you have to aware the disadvantages of online shopping.
Just as every coin has two sides, shopping on the Interent also has its shortage.
For one thing, the consumers are neither able to examine the products nor try them on, while others complain that they cannot touch, smell or taste what they are going to purchase.
As far as I am concerned, shopping online is convenient indeed.
However, we should pour more attention into selecting the products and choosing the most trustworthy online shop.
As is known to us, if you want to be successful , you must work hard .

In my opinion , getting online is a pretty positive way to study and relax ourselves.
On the on hand, i think the punishment is the very important means.

Recently, continual social incidents have been appeared.
There is no doubt that the journalism wold report them in time even ahead of time.
However, during the process of reporting, there existed a series of problems between the reporter and the person involved.
For example, some journalism have distorted or stretch the facts, which cause someone's displeasure.
Sometimes the journalist starts or spread a rumour of the celebrity such as the entertainment gossip.
I think this behavior invade the privacy of somebody like Wenzhang, who was discovered an extramarital affair with Yao.
What's more, the journalism also expose the corruption of the government, which most citizens approve of.
But everything should be done within control, if journalist exposes something without curl, it's not allowed by the law.
In fact, they have already interfered the private life of some people when they published the report.
But on the other side, we have to admit the truth that the journalism is the bridge between celebrity and the commoners, between the foreign and the domestic.
We can nearly obtain all the latest information all over the world from it, especially on the Internet.
So the journalism is necessary.
And at the same time, the truth of it appeared pretty important.
In the information age, since we cannot distinguish right from wrong by ourselves, we have to believe some opinions that most people hold blindly.
In conclusion, I think above all the journalist should insist to seek the facts, secondly, I wish they had better not express their individual opinion on the issue because everyone has their own likes.
Last but not least, as for the privacy, the journalist ought to be appropriate to know and publish it.
I have been a college student for a year in which I found the college is like a new world, there are many fresh, fancy and attractive things that waiting for you to explore.

It is convenient, for you can connect others easily and quickly.

When I was six year old.
My mother told me some advise.
She said she hoped me to read some bookes such as some novel by the famous writers.
And she said the traditional reading is better than online reading.

His love makes me depend on him, as the child depend on the shoulders, the tears depend on the face.
When I stay with him I can be myself, do everything what I want to do.
The most important reason why I love him is that he is himself.
Finally, it seems to be a tendency that people depend too much on cell phones.
It's no doubt that books are our best friends.
And we all know that we should make the most of the books.
One reason why they have the view is that they think the way can help them has a wide knowledge of fresh things that they never know .
In a way, when we refer to the way how to read, we don't mean that we only can choose one way to learn .
We can read both selectively and extensively.

Everyone should know computer is the most useful things in our daily life.
Over-reliance on computers will bring a lot of problems.
First of all, computer has a great many radiation that will hurt our healthy, result in cut down our immunity go with we grow up.
Then, when we watch too much on computer, our sight will be obscure.
Finally, computer is a virtual world, there are harmful messages while we search on the Internet, and those messages can changes our mind.
In my opinion, Appropriate use of computer is good for us.
When we search on the Internet, We must have the ability to distinguish between good and bad information.
And we can not easily believe that other people say .
From the invention of cellphones to now, during which most of people are crazy about using the cellphones.
The advantages are as follows.
Firstly, they make people's commiunication convenient greatly.
The cellphones also play a bad role in daily life , when students are using them to do something.

 While speaking, the father pointed the dustbin.
When people walk on the road , they often look phone to see their friends's message .

Although I have studying the Faculty of Journalism in collage, I want to be a store manager of snack store.
First step: Feankly speaking, I don't want to waste the knowledge what I got.

Even, it is a danger at any time and any place when a journalist have a private interview.

Fast food, akind of west food , is very popular in China now.
Here are four reasons.
First of all, fast food is convenient and it saves our precious time.

Second, you can not only eat at fast food store, but also pick up them and come back home to eat.
Third, almost all of the fast food stores are clean and make customers feel good.
But fast food has less nutrition.
And it's bad for your health if you often eat it.
So, in my opinion, we could eat fast food if there is no time.
And just eat it once in a while.

China has 5000 years old history.
When we learn the cultures from other countries, we also have the responsible to tell them about ours.

when talking about an important person, firstly Mancy will appear in my head.
She is my classmate in high school.
She is a little bit short with a pair of small eyes.

Nowadays, we can see, in university, skipping classes is normal.
University is a place where we can learn and develop ourselves.
It's a free atmersphere.
we have the right to choose what classes we have to attend, not attend every class.
It's more easy for teachers to teach us.
as we all know, some students will skip the class they don't like.
For teachers, it's upset to see studends skip their class, then, that will influence reachers' mood to teach others.
And, those skipped classes will have publishment on the other hand.

In my opinion, it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts.
For example, if a doctor needs to do an operation, then she or he has to know the facts of the patient instead of the concepts or the ideas of the operation.
But even it is more important for the students to learn the facts, they still need to understand the ideas and concepts.
Let's go back to the operation again.
If you don't know the ideas and concepts about the operation, then I am pretty sure that you cannot finish the operation in the right way, and maybe you will fail the operation owing to your ignorance of the ideas and concepts.
In a word, students should pay more attention to the facts than to the ideas and concepts.
At the meanwhile, ideas and concepts are still very important.

On the one hand, most of them think that government is supposed to prohibit it.

After doing the breakfast, I wanted to help my mom to do the housework.
Fist, I went to the kitchen to do the dishes and clean it up.
I washed dishes while listening to it again, so I don't feel bored.
Ten minutes later, the kitchen became very clean and tidy.

After five minutes, the floor is very bright.
Then, I went to the living room to water the flowers.
Some flowers wither quickly and I took the kettle watering them.

When we want to find a book which is hard to find in the library, we can use e-book.
At the same time, we should control the time that reading e-book.

companies.
Since American sub prime triggered a global financial crisis in 2007, governments have taken a lot of stimulus measures, and the economy has been gradually recovering, the enterprise order began to increase.
However, enterprise, because of the financial crisis, fired some staff.
The contributing reason is the labor structure is not reasonable.
At present, all kinds of colleges, in the process of training talents, disjoint labor market demand.

Graduate students always have higher expectations and lack the spirit of endure a hardship.
So companies are reluctant to hire them in some individual regions, and graduate students don't want to go to it.
Last but not least, labor-intensive enterprises' labor demand is strong.
